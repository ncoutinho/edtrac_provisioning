Infrastructure autoomation code for reproducing a production like environment for Edutrac

You need to install the following on your system 
1. VirtualBox
2. Vagrant

Instructions 
1. After installing Vagrant and Virtual Box
2. create the edtrac_box virtual box by running this command 
	vagrant box add edtrac_box /path/to/your/vagrantimage.box
	(the path could be a url to the box or path on the filesystem if you have the box downloaded on your machine)
3. cd into your project root and run command vagrant init
4. Replace the contents of  Vagrantfile by those in Vagrantfile.exapmle in edtrack_provisioning 
5. Edit the Vagrantfile and point to the path to your vagrantbox if you have it on your machine if  you don't, (Skip this step) you will need a good network connection though.
6. Edit the Vagrantfile and point to the path to your cookbooks e.g ~/your_username/chef-repos/edtrac_provisioning/cookbooks/  
7. Now run vagrant up and you are good to go!

NOTE:

After a successfull provisioning, you may want to avoid provisioning every time you boot vagrant with out re-provisioning. 
To do so boot vagrant using the command below:

vagrant up --no-provision
